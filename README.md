## Running in VSC then install below plugins:

- Karate Runner
- Jave extension pack

## Running in IntelliJ
If you use IntelliJ IDEA, Cucumber support is built-in, and you can even select a single Scenario within a Feature to run at a time. If you are using the free Community Edition, you can easily install the "Gherkin" and "Cucumber for Java" plugins.

## Project Setup
I created my Karate project using the Maven archetype since I am quite familiar with Maven. I named my project "karate-api-automation":

mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.intuit.karate \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=karate-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=0.9.0 \
  -DgroupId=com.karateautomation \
  -DartifactId=karate-api-automation
